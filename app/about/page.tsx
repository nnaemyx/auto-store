            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Welcome to Autostores.ng — your one-stop online destination for everything auto. We&apos;re more
              than just an e-commerce platform; we&apos;re a dynamic, service-focused marketplace built to
              connect you with the right auto parts, accessories, tools, treatments, and more.

              a specific part, we&apos;re here to make your search faster, easier, and more reliable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
              We founded Autostores.ng to bridge the gap between automotive buyers and sellers in today&apos;s
              fast-moving, digital world. We know how frustrating it can be to hunt for the right part at the right
              price — especially from a trustworthy source.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
              That&apos;s why we do the heavy lifting:
              You tell us what you need — we source, verify, compare, and deliver.
              No stress. Just the right parts, from the right sources, at the best value.
